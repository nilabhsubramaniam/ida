## Remaining Tasks

- Optional: Refactor large component styles to reduce bundle size (topbar.component.scss, welcome.component.scss, login.component.scss)

## How to Deploy
1. Run `./test-deployment.sh` to test deployment locally
2. When ready, run `./push-to-github.sh` to push changes to GitHub
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Visit `https://nilabhsubramaniam.github.io/ida/` to see the deployed application

## Notes
- The GitHub Actions workflow automatically detects your GitHub username and repository name
- To customize the deployment, edit the `.github/workflows/angular-deploy.yml` file
- For any routing issues, check the 404.html file and the app.config.ts configuration
