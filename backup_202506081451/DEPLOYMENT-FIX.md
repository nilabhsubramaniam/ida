# Fixed GitHub Pages Deployment

This update fixes the GitHub Pages deployment by properly handling the Angular 17+ build output structure.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Now correctly handles files from the `browser` subdirectory
   - Removes unnecessary test files from the deployment
   - Simplifies the verification process

2. **Simplified Build and Deployment**
   - Created a clean deployment script
   - Removed unnecessary redirect files
   - Fixed the directory structure

3. **Removed Test Files**
   - Cleaned up the workspace
   - Removed temporary test and documentation files
   - Kept only essential deployment scripts

## How to Deploy

To build and test locally:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Notes

The infinite redirect loop issue is fixed by ensuring the actual Angular app is directly served at the root URL with hash-based routing properly configured.
