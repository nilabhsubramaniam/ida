# Angular GitHub Pages Fix with Meta Redirect and Hash Routing

## The Problem

The Angular application deployed to GitHub Pages (nilabhsubramaniam.github.io/ida/) was experiencing an infinite redirect loop causing rapid page refreshes. This was happening because:

1. The JavaScript-based redirects were creating a loop
2. Complex redirect logic with sessionStorage was causing race conditions
3. The path-based routing was conflicting with GitHub Pages' handling of URLs

## The Solution

We've implemented a two-part solution:

### 1. Meta Redirect Tags

We replaced the complex JavaScript redirect logic with simple HTML meta redirect tags:

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/ida/#/">
```

This approach:
- Works even when JavaScript is disabled
- Is processed by browsers before any JavaScript can run
- Avoids redirect loops by being simpler and more direct
- Doesn't rely on sessionStorage or complex path handling

### 2. Hash-Based Routing Strategy

We configured Angular to use hash-based routing (`/#/` in URLs):

```typescript
provideRouter(
  routes,
  withHashLocation() // Use hash location strategy
)
```

This approach:
- Keeps all navigation on the client side without hitting the server
- Prevents 404 errors that trigger redirects
- Works reliably on GitHub Pages without special server configuration
- Makes URLs look like `/ida/#/dashboard` instead of `/ida/dashboard`

## Files Created/Modified

1. **app.config.hash.ts**: Special configuration for hash-based routing
2. **404-meta-redirect.html**: Ultra-simple meta redirect for 404 pages
3. **index-meta.html**: Simple meta redirect for the root domain
4. **validate-hash-routing.sh**: Script to test the fix locally
5. **GitHub Actions workflow**: Updated to use these new files

## Testing

You can test this solution locally:

1. Run `./validate-hash-routing.sh`
2. Start a local server with the built files
3. Verify that navigation works without redirect loops

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to GitHub
2. Verify that GitHub Pages is using the gh-pages branch and root directory
3. Test direct navigation to `/ida/#/dashboard` and other routes
4. Monitor browser console for any redirect issues

## Why This Works

The root cause of the infinite redirect loop was the conflict between Angular's client-side routing and GitHub Pages' server behavior. By using hash-based routing, we keep all navigation client-side, never triggering the server's 404 handler, and the meta redirects ensure a simple, reliable redirect when needed.
